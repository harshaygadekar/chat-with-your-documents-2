# chat-with-your-documents-2
This is an another AI-powered document summarizer application built with Streamlit. It leverages advanced language models from LLaMA-3 and FastEmbed for efficient document embedding and summarization. The application allows users to upload PDF documents, generate concise summaries, and interact with the summaries through a chat interface for follow-up questions.

Unlike my previous chat-with-your-documents project which was built using Langchain. In this project, I've actually used Meta LLaMa-3 and streamlit to create a GUI which makes the use-case much simpler and effective.
